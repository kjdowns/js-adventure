# Javascript Adventure

Javascript Adventure is a 2D Dungeon crawling game using HTML5, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails. Take on the role of The Wizard and fight your way through 10 levels of monsters to emerge victorious and conquer The Dungeon. You are also able to save and load progress using the Username and load/save buttons underneath the main game viewport. Controls and player health are displayed on the left side bar. Movement is controlled with the arrow buttons, and spells can be fired with "z" for a fireball and "x" for an ice spike. You only have 10 health with which to complete the entire guantlet, so be cautious! The game will end when the player has depleted all of their health or reached the end.
